# INparmetis

This is a piece of code that is meant to partition a graph with ParMETIS.
It is meant to serve as an example, but also as a tester.

The following are found in the file:

0. A function to dump the adjacency structure to files (like a distributed

1. A checker for the adjacency structure (out of bounds).

2. A generator of the distributed adjacency structure corresponding to a 1D
Laplacian.
